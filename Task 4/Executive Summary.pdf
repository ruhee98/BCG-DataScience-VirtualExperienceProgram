###Hypothesis:
- Powerco has a problem with customer churn; they believe it is caused by
customers' price sensitivities. One possible solution is to provide 20% off to
customers who are most likely to start leaving.

###Machine Learning Modeling:
- After Data cleaning, EDA and Feature engineering, I applied Random Forest
Classifier. Random Forest Classifier model has been built to predict
customersâ€™ churn probability, achieving an accuracy of 0.90 and Precision
score of 0.91 on the test set.
###Insights:

- Nearly 10% (9.7%) of the customers have churned and 90% of the customers
have not churned.
- Yearly consumption, forecasted consumption and net margin are the 3 largest
drivers
- Time seems to be an influential factor, especially the number of months they
have been active, so is their tenure and the number of months since they
updated their contract
- Our price sensitivity features are scattered around but are not the main driver
for a customer
- Offer discount to only to high -value customers with high churn probability
